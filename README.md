Hi, my name is Leanne!

I am an aunt of many! I love being an aunt but at time it can be quite challanging!
I am luck to have my fiancee by my side and she means the world to me! She is my rock and we are excited to marry soon!
In my alone times, I pray to my God! In these trying times, my faith is what helps me to keep going!
I am a security systems analyst and I'm passionate about learning new information in the cybersecurity world!
